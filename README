A client of mine made a custom module called Assignments which had
50,000+ entries. He needed to upload 147,000+ documents and set a
relationship between the Assignemnts and the Documents.  The name of the
Assignment and the name of the Document were listed in a CSV file.  This
program does precisely that. I had trouble finding examples on how to do
this (and the ones I did find were woefully out of date) and the
SugarCRM/SuiteCRM documentation needs serious work.

!!!!!!!! DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO RUN !!!!!!!!!!  
 THIS IS ONLY FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY

You don't have my data files, you don't have my custom module, you don't
have my setup. Also, I've taken out a lot of logging and error correction
to make the code cleaner to read.

Once again:
